# MIPS-Processor
A MIPS processor implemented using VHDL. The processor supports all the functionalities expected in a standard MIPS processor.

## Getting Started and Executing the Processor

In order to execute the code you will need to download and install a VHDL IDE.

## Supported Functionality
* *add (signed or unsigned)* - Adds two 32-bit numbers.
* *addi (signed or unsigned)* - Adds an immediate value with a 32-bit number.
* *sub (signed or unsigned)* - Subtracts two 32-bit numbers.
* *subi (signed or unsigned)* - Subtracts an immediate value with a 32-bit number.
* *mul (signed or unsigned)* - Multiplies two 32-bit numbers.
* *muli (signed or unsigned)* - Multiplies an immediate value with a 32-bit number.
* *slt (signed or unsigned)* - Returns 1 if a number is less than another number, returns 0 otherwise.
* *or* - Returns the 'or' of two 32-bit numbers.
* *and* - Returns the 'and' of two 32-bit numbers.
* *andi* - Returns the 'and' of an immediate value and a 32-bit number.
